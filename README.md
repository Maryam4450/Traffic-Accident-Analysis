# üöó Traffic Accident Analysis & Injury Prediction

## üìù Overview

This project is a **Streamlit-based web application** designed to analyze traffic accident data and predict the total number of injuries using a **Random Forest Regressor** model. The application provides an interactive interface for **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and real-time **injury predictions** based on user inputs for various crash-related features such as weather, road conditions, and crash type.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
  - Missing value analysis
  - Summary statistics
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - Trend analysis
  - Grouped visualizations (weather, lighting, crash type, etc.)

- **Injury Prediction**:  
  Utilizes a Random Forest Regressor to predict the total number of injuries based on user-provided features.

- **Interactive Interface**:  
  - Built with Streamlit, allowing users to toggle EDA sections and input features for predictions.
  - Real-time predictions based on selected input features
  - Clean and responsive UI
  - Categorical encoding error-handling

- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features for robust model performance.

##  Dataset 

The application uses a dataset [traffic_accidents](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oktayrdeki/traffic-accidents?resource=download) from kaggle containing traffic accident records with columns such as:
- **`crash_date`**: The date the accident occurred.
- **`traffic_control_device`**: The type of traffic control device involved (e.g., traffic light, sign).
- **`weather_condition`**: The weather conditions at the time of the accident.
- **`lighting_condition`**: The lighting conditions at the time of the accident.
- **`first_crash_type`**: The initial type of the crash (e.g., head-on, rear-end).
- **`trafficway_type`**: The type of roadway involved in the accident (e.g., highway, local road).
- **`alignment`**: The alignment of the road where the accident occurred (e.g., straight, curved).
- **`roadway_surface_cond`**: The condition of the roadway surface (e.g., dry, wet, icy).
- **`road_defect`**: Any defects present on the road surface.
- **`crash_type`**: The overall type of the crash.
- **`intersection_related_i`**: Whether the accident was related to an intersection.
- **`damage`**: The extent of the damage caused by the accident.
- **`prim_contributory_cause`**: The primary cause contributing to the crash.
- **`num_units`**: The number of vehicles involved in the accident.
- **`most_severe_injury`**: The most severe injury sustained in the crash.
- **`injuries_total`**: The total number of injuries reported.
- **`injuries_fatal`**: The number of fatal injuries resulting from the accident.
- **`injuries_incapacitating`**: The number of incapacitating injuries.
- **`injuries_non_incapacitating`**: The number of non-incapacitating injuries.
- **`injuries_reported_not_evident`**: The number of injuries reported but not visibly evident.
- **`injuries_no_indication`**: The number of cases with no indication of injury.
- **`crash_hour`**: The hour the accident occurred.
- **`crash_day_of_week`**: The day of the week the accident occurred.
- **`crash_month`**: The month the accident occurred.
Note: Ensure the dataset is properly formatted and placed in the project directory before running the app.
